## **Technologies, Libraries, APIs**

* The `Color API` to get color code
* `Webpack` to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code



## **Implementation Timeline**
- **Friday Afternoon & Weekend:** Set up project, including getting webpack up and running. Get Color and spending time to play with API to get comfortable using it. 

- **Monday:** Hopefully start implementng layouts of pages and work on visualizing base webpage.

- **Tuesday:** Dedicate toward implementing the underlying logic of color extraction. Working on ajax to render page when actioned. Make sure all the action render correctly.

- **Wednesday:** Focus implementing manipulation. Make sure manipualation works properly only the part we selected with selected color.

- **Thursday Morning:** Try wrap up everything and see everything works properly, and try to update proposal if anything new added or updated.
